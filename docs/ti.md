# Frontend Technical Interview Questions - Senior Vue Developer

## Project Overview
This technical interview is based on a task management application built with **Nuxt 4**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Pinia** for state management. The application follows modern Vue.js best practices and implements a comprehensive feature set including authentication, task management, drag-and-drop functionality, and real-time search.

## 1. Architecture & Project Structure

### Q1.1: Project Organization
**Question:** Looking at the project structure, explain the architectural decisions behind organizing the codebase into `app/shared`, `app/features`, and `app/components` directories. How does this structure benefit maintainability and scalability?

**Expected Answer:**
- **Feature-based organization**: The `app/features` directory groups related functionality (auth, tasks) with their own stores, composables, and components
- **Shared utilities**: The `app/shared` directory contains reusable components, composables, and utilities that can be used across features
- **Separation of concerns**: Each feature is self-contained with its own business logic, making it easier to maintain and test
- **Scalability**: New features can be added without affecting existing code, and shared components promote code reuse

### Q1.2: Nuxt 4 Configuration
**Question:** Explain the key configuration choices in `nuxt.config.ts`, particularly the alias setup, runtime config, and Nitro proxy configuration. How do these choices impact development and production?

**Expected Answer:**
- **Alias configuration**: Provides clean import paths (`@shared`, `@features`) that improve code readability and make refactoring easier
- **Runtime config**: Centralizes environment variables and configuration, making the app environment-aware
- **Nitro proxy**: Handles API proxying during development, avoiding CORS issues and providing a seamless development experience
- **TypeScript integration**: Ensures type safety across the application

## 2. State Management with Pinia

### Q2.1: Store Architecture
**Question:** Analyze the Pinia store implementation in `useTaskStore`. Explain how the state, getters, and actions are organized, and discuss the benefits of this approach over traditional Vuex.

**Expected Answer:**
- **Modular stores**: Each feature has its own store (`auth`, `task`) with clear boundaries
- **TypeScript integration**: Strong typing with interfaces for state and actions
- **Computed getters**: `filteredTasks` and `tasksForCurrentDate` provide reactive computed values
- **Action organization**: Clear separation between API calls and state mutations
- **Benefits over Vuex**: Simpler API, better TypeScript support, less boilerplate, and more intuitive structure

### Q2.2: Composables Pattern
**Question:** Explain the composables pattern used in `useTask` and `useAuth`. How does this pattern improve code reusability and testing?

**Expected Answer:**
- **Composables as abstraction layer**: Provide a clean interface between components and stores
- **Reactive state exposure**: Use `computed()` to expose reactive store state
- **Action delegation**: Directly expose store actions for component use
- **Testing benefits**: Composables can be easily unit tested in isolation
- **Reusability**: Same composable can be used across multiple components

## 3. TypeScript Implementation

### Q3.1: Type Safety
**Question:** How is TypeScript used throughout the application to ensure type safety? Provide examples from the codebase and explain the benefits.

**Expected Answer:**
- **Interface definitions**: Clear interfaces for `Task`, `User`, `ApiResponse`, etc.

- **Store typing**: Pinia stores use typed state and actions
- **API responses**: Generic types for API responses ensure data consistency
- **Benefits**: Catch errors at compile time, better IDE support, self-documenting code, easier refactoring

### Q3.2: Global Type Declarations
**Question:** Explain the purpose of `app/shared/types/nuxt.d.ts` and how it enhances the development experience.

**Expected Answer:**
- **Global type declarations**: Makes Nuxt auto-imports available globally without explicit imports
- **Development experience**: Provides autocomplete and type checking for Nuxt composables
- **Consistency**: Ensures all developers use the same type definitions
- **Reduces boilerplate**: No need to import common Vue/Nuxt functions
